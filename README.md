## Physiotherapy
<p>
Physiotherapy is the treatment of disease, injury, or deformity by physical methods exercise rather than by drugs or surgery. Physiotherapy treatments are generally for long period of time(couple of weeks or months).It becomes expensive as well as time consuming to visit physiotherapist every day.
<br><br>This project is an attempt to create a system using computer vision that can guide, act as a personal virtual trainer that would help people do exercises. A system that focuses more on form than on reps.

## Description
Physiotherapy is a trending medication for curing bone related injuries and pain.
 In many cases, due to sudden jerks or accidents, a patient may suffer from severe pain. 
Our aim here is to build a framework using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for providing users with a digitized system for physiotherapy.
 By using specialized techniques, our system will detect angle between the joints and depending upon the range of motion it will guide the patient in accomplishing physiotherapy at home
