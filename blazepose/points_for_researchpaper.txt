1) data collection
i)decide phases 

* data gathering method

ii) perform each pose of the phase assign the collected keypoints a unique label  

*data storing in form of json

iii) data of a single exercise which consititute of several phases stored in a 
separate file 

2)model training
classification: build a classifier to explicitly detect phases of the exercise usinf neural network
specs:
input layer 34
hidden layer:16,activation:relu ,kernel initialier:fan_avg_normal,
output: 5,activation: softmax


predict:
1st :
excersise is divided into phases
2nd :
sequence of phases is decided accordingly 
3rd :
